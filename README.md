- Preparation and analysis of the dataset. 
- Training and validation of Convolutional Neural Networks
- CNN hyper parameters (e.g., learning rate and optimization function)
- CNN structure (e.g., number of filters and number of convolutional layers, kernel size, strides, dilation rate, among others; number of filters and number of nodes of dense layers) 
- CNN loss function. 
- Genetic Algorithms (GA) for learning model hyper parameter optimization, structure
optimization and loss function optimization.
